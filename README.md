# pupillometry-pipeline
A Matlab-based user interface for analyzing pupillometry data, written by Scott Watter &amp; Isaac Kinley

## How to use

Run `pupl_init` to add all the functions to Matlab's path and initialize the user interface and global variables. From here, you can use the user interface to process and segment your data.

If you would like to automate your pipeline, you can run `pupl_history` to print the commands the user interface was running under the hood. These can be copied and pasted into a script for reproducibility.

See /docs/manual.pdf for a detailed guide.
