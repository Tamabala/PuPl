In version 2.0.0, the export tool has been simplified quite a bit.
Previously, data could be downsampled at the export stage using a moving
mean---when combined with variable-length epochs, it could easily become
impossible to export the epoch data to wide format and have the data's
column names mean anything. Moreover, this export-specific downsampling
tool was always redundant with PuPl's pre-existing filtering and
downsampling tools. Therefore it has been removed, and when exporting epoch
data, undownsampled data is always used.

Moreover, when exporting statistics computed on sub-epoch windows, the same
statistics will be computed for each window. This simplifies the user
interface so that you do not have to re-select your statistics for each
sub-epoch window (it also simplifies the code internally).

Finally, the UI options pertaining to exporting have been simplified. Now
they are labelled "Export epoch statistics" and "Export epoch data", where
prevoiusly they were called "Write statistics to spreadsheet" and "Export
[un]downsampled data".
