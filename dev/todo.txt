Final to-do list

Curr version: 0.9
0.9.1: Handling reaction times
	Alter presentation event log readers to read reaction times
	DONE - Make tsv2eventlog convert 'n/a' to NaN
	DONE - Add option to reject trials by reaction time
    DONE - Delete rejectbyextremediam
	Add option to view heatmap of trials sorted by reaction time-ask Dr Watter
	Write reaction time info to stats sheet-ask Dr Watter
0.9.2: Handling raw data readers
	Make read edf Octave-compatible
	Add tool for reading non-excel Tobii
    Add tools for reading other formats:
        1.
0.9.3: Odds and ends
	Add tool for rejecting trials on the basis of bad baselines (by missing data)
		Integrate this with trial rejection tools
	Add option to reload raw data from src
	If multiple datasets are passed into trimdiam, reset the average of each stream to the grand average of all streams
	Create tool for writing and reading participants.tsv
		unique(mergefields(EYE, 'BIDS', 'sub'));
	Write cond field to stats sheet
	Add tool for marking error trials
		markerrortrials(eyeData, 'lims', {'-2s' '
	Add tool for calculating reaction times
		calcrts(eyeData, 'onsets', {'trialType1' 'trialType2'}, 'responses', {'response'})
	Add tool for re-mapping sourcedata to raw (in case folders are transferred between computers)
0.9.4: Thorough testing
	Create dummy eye data for testing and test it using Octave in traditional mode
		Continuous data begins as a flat line at 100
		Pre-experiment baseline: flat line at 25 for 10 seconds
		Pre-trial block baseline: flat line at 50 for 5 seconds
		Gaze is random within [-250 250] x [-150 150]
		Pupil diameter is linear in gaze y, quadratic in gaze x
		Trials of one type should be a sine wave, of another should be a negative sine wave
		An external event log with a constant time offset should also exist
		10% of data should have 50% missing data, another 30% should have 10% missing data
